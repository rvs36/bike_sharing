# Predicting demand for a Bike sharing platform

As a part of Machine Learnign course I followed, did a project on predicting demand for a bike sharing platform. 

Historical bike ride information and associated weather data (scapeed from the internet).  

The project followed the gievn broad pipeline:  
• Missing Value Analysis  
• Outlier Analysis  
• Correlation Analysis  
• Visualizing Distribution Of Data  
• Visualizing Count Vs (Month,Season,Hour,Weekday,Usertype)  
• Feature Engineering  
• Model Building STAGE 1 - Counts by hour  
• Model Building STAGE 2 - Counts by hour by station  
• Model Evaluation  
• Interpretation of the results  

**Models used:**  
RandomForest  
Bagging  
Gradient Boosting  

**The best resluts were obtained using Random Forest Classifier**
